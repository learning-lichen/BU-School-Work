I was able to computer the answer, up to five significant digits, in 6 steps. 
The answer was 12.0005457307424. You know when to stop when your average changes
very little. As for sqrt(5), 2.23606797749979 is definitely not the exact 
square root, because 2.23606797749979 is rational and the square root of 5 is
known to be irrational. 

I computer sqrt(5e+30) to be 2236067977499789.5 in 50 steps.
